**Exercise 6: Image Gallery with Lightbox**

_Instructions:_

1. Create a new HTML file named `image_gallery.html`.
2. Insert multiple images into the HTML file using the `<img>` element.
3. Use CSS to style the images as a grid or flexbox layout.
4. We could try to do this manually but it's not that easy and we have tools that can help us to do that. Research and find a JavaScript library for creating a lightbox effect (e.g., [Lightbox2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)).
